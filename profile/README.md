### Welcome to Agent Lab
> Taking actions intelligently is all we study 

We are interested in research on agent taking actions through Deep Learning, 
with a particular focus on machine learning techniques such as deep reinforcement learning and learning from demonstration. 
We are applying these methods to problems in video games, robotics and multi-agent systems.

On-going projects: 
* Policy gradients in large-scale training; 
* Transformers and generative models for decision-making tasks;
* Online learning from interactions and demonstrations.
