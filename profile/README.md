### Welcome to Agent Lab
> Taking actions is all we care 

We are interested in research on taking actions through Deep Learning. On-going projects: 
* Policy gradients in large-scale training; 
* Transformers and generative models for decision-making tasks;
* Online learning from interactions and demonstrations.
